# World Map

Getting a plot of the world map is really simple. There are only three lines needed:


```{r, warning=FALSE}
require(nCov2019)
x = get_nCov2019(lang='en')
plot(x)
```


As you can see, the confirmed number of cases in China compared to everywhere else is scarily high. You may wonder now, is there a way to break down the cases in China? Of course, but you must first install chinamap, to get the map of China.

```{r}
remotes::install_github("GuangchuangYu/chinamap") # comment this segment after you have run it
```

After the installation, you can run the following code to see the confirmed cases across China.
```{r}
require(chinamap)
cn = get_map_china()
## translate province 
cn$province <- trans_province(cn$province)
plot(x, chinamap=cn)
```
You should now see that China is broken down to individual provinces. Note that the provinces must be translated like above in order for China to be colored.

If the color red doesn’t suit you, you can feel free to change it using the palette argument:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot(x, chinamap=cn, palette="Purples")
```

## China Map
To get a closer look at what the situation is in China, you can add a region = ‘china'argument to the plot. I recommend using font.size=2 so that the text of the provinces aren’t too large.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot(x, region='china', chinamap=cn, font.size=2)
```




# Supercool heatmap of the global situation in the last 7 days

Here we will build an overview of the global landscape of coronavirus in one condensed tiled chart.
First we prepare the data by selecting the global list from the historical nCov2019 package

```{r prepping for tiled chart, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
y <- load_nCov2019(lang = 'en')
d <- y['global']
```

Next, we limit the time to go back 7 days and filter out all missing values. We set the colors to change with exponential differences to counts and sort the countries by number of confirmed cases

```{r tiled chart of confirmed cases}
max_time <- max(d$time)
min_time <- max_time - 7
d <- na.omit(d[d$time >= min_time & d$time <= max_time,])  # we are selecting values in the last 7 days
dd <- d[d$time == max(d$time, na.rm = TRUE),]
d$country <- factor(d$country, 
                    levels=dd$country[order(dd$cum_confirm)])   # we want countries sorted by number of cases
breaks = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000)

```

Finally, we plot the result with geom_tile()
```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(time, country)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = cum_confirm), color = 'black') + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(trans = 'log', breaks = breaks, 
                       labels = breaks) + 
  xlab(NULL) + ylab(NULL) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m-%d") + theme_minimal()
```

You can also view the chart for the healed or dead and extend the time horizon as you wish.


# Homework
Task 1 - can you download a map of Denmark and its provinces and plot the confirmed cases across Denmark similar to the China map example? Hint: do some searches on Github (https://github.com/sebastianbarfort/mapDK)

Task 2 -  can you create a heatmap of deaths due to covid across the world?
